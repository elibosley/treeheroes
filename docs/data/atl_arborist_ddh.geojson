        "tree_description": "If left in place, this invasive Carolina Laurel is likely to spread and outcompete desirable vegetation for sunlight, water, and nutrients, leading to the decline of surrounding plants. Over time, it can disrupt the balance and design of the landscape, increase maintenance needs due to uncontrolled growth, and potentially cause root or structural issues near nearby features. Its continued presence may negatively affect the long-term health, appearance, and value of the property.Reason for Removal:Invasive/undesirable tree\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                         Parcel Information\n                                \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    \n\t\tParcel Number:17 00520008071 *Block:--Lot:--Subdivision:--",
