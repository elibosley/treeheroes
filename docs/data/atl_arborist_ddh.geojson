While the upper crown appears seasonally normal, the root system, structural root plate, and critical root zone show long-standing impacts. On the west side, the structural root plate is impacted at approximately five feet, where it should be roughly eleven feet for a tree of this size, representing an estimated 20 to 25 percent SRP impact. Within that portion of the SRP and CRZ, multiple large structural and other roots are deteriorated and chronically damaged, with visible decay, past mechanical injury, and areas of erosion and root loss. The soil surface on the west side also shows evidence of historic compaction and wear consistent with regular vehicular or equipment use, which has further limited root development. The grade falls away from the tree on that side, and once the leaves were blown away, the total affected area was visually estimated at approximately 40 percent of the CRZ. Although the canopy presents as typical for this species in dormancy, the existing SRP and CRZ damage materially reduces anchorage on the west side. These pre-existing conditions exceed the City of Atlanta's allowable SRP and CRZ impacts.",
