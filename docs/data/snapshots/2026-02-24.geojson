A parking area is directly under the canopy, and branches have already failed and struck the vehicles. the home is within the fall distance of the tree and considering the FFB, whole stem failure could be imminent. large, dead scaffold branches remain in canopy and are causing the owners to not have use of their parking area. the owners say the tree's swaying in the wind strom recently looked abnormal. they are worried about their home.
