The primary defect appears encircled by fusiform rust with outer margins that are indented and undercut into the stem, creating a depressed central area with surrounding wood deformation. This defect is located on a primary leader carrying significant load and is visually observable from the right front of the residence using binocular or visual aids.\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                         Parcel Information\n                                \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    \n\t\tParcel Number:17 00500010040 *Block:--Lot:--Subdivision:--",
